## How to Play

1. Open [Issue #1](../../issues/1)
2. Comment `/move U`, `/move D`, `/move L`, or `/move R` to move the snake
3. The board updates automatically every hour (or when triggered manually)
4. Eat food to grow and increase your score!
5. Avoid walls and your own body

⏰ **Note:** Each player has a 30-second cooldown between moves to keep the game fair and fun!

**🟢 Green squares** = Snake body  
**🔵 Blue square** = Snake head (front) - this is the part that moves!  
**🔴 Red square** = Food
